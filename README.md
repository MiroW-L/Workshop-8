## Let's do it (31/1/25)
- Okay starting watching Leo's guide and looking through the open source/free use API guide for interesting websites that I can use in my own code and found a few options, however some are not written using json which is frustrating but I'll keep searching. First I will finish Leo's guide and then I will try add my webpage into my code and if I need help I will use DeepSeek.
- I worked realy hard on searching for an API that worked however what was really frustrating was that none of them worked when I tried to complete them in the same way Leo completed his on the guide, the insults weren't showing up when I tried using insult, the bears weren't showing up when I tried using bear pictures, this was very frustrating for me.
- I turned to trying to use DeepSeek to try and solve my code and see if any improvements could be made, however wheever I tried some of their suggestions the data wouldnt load in properly, as seen here:

## Trying again
- I then found a gif generator called yes/noi and decided that if the images i was selecting weren't showign up then maybe I could represetn them in a different way, and so then I thought maybe I could use emojis to show te outcome of the API selecting one of the outcomes.
- This isn't an ideal outcome but I really feel puzzled by this and want to get some one on one help with this, hpowever I have run out of time

## Some help from DeepSeek to make sure my coding was correct and I added some more emojis to be cute
